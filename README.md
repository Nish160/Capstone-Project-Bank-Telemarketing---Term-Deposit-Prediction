# Capstone-Project-Bank-Telemarketing---Term-Deposit-Prediction
The increasingly vast number of marketing campaigns over time has reduced its effect on the general public. Economic pressures and competition have led marketing managers to invest on directed campaigns with a strict and rigorous selection of contacts: lesser contacts should be done, with better success rate. Although telemarketing is a direct mode of communication with the prospective customer, this may make customers grumpy.  In this Project, Exploratory Data Analysis, Statistical Tests, Imbalanced Data treatment and Predictive modeling is used in determining the main characteris-tics that affect success and selection of potential buying customers. Classifica-tion algorithms like Logistic Regression, CART, KNN, and ensemble algo-rithms like random forest and XG Boost were used to build the model using the most popular tool python and the appropriate model is selected based on F1-score, ROC, Accuracy value and False Negative value (FN). Further, this project also attempts to provide model interpretability that may help bank target the right customers.
